# Thomas Lower CFGAA Assignment

## Ideas

- .ABC viewer
- Voxel Based Colony Management Game [Link To Steam for inspiration](https://store.steampowered.com/app/366090/Colony_Survival/)
- Forest generator - exports to USD or Houdini or maybe Maya (it exports to something idk what yet)
- Melee Weapon Generator (parametrically generates weapons based on a list of factors)

## Selected Idea

I have opted to do the voxel based colony management game.
Please see below the class diagram for such:
