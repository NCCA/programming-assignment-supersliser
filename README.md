## Ideas

- .ABC viewer
- Voxel Based Colony Management Game [Link To Steam for inspiration](https://store.steampowered.com/app/366090/Colony_Survival/)
- Forest generator - exports to USD or Houdini or maybe Maya (it exports to something idk what yet)
- Melee Weapon Generator (parametrically generates weapons based on a list of factors)

## Selected Idea

I have opted to do the voxel based colony management game.
Please see below the class diagram for such:

I will be using SDL rather than QT as this is a game project, therefore SDL makes more sense.

## ECS

ECS Stands for Entity Component System. This design pattern allows for a game which is optimised with cache coherency in mind.

Specifically, I am working with a Table based ECS. This works by grouping data by the component type, then storing all entities with similar components in a table. Finally, systems are used to edit and update the data within the components.

In essence, this code works by having a table for each type of entity (colonists, blocks, etc...) as all of these will have the same components, each table then contains a vector of Columns, which each contain a vector of the data for that component. A component is then applied as a type on a type in a system which then iterates over the columns and applies the logic of the system to the data.

In Conclusion, this game is an excel spreadsheet with a GUI. (the "with a GUI" part was generated by GitHub Copilot and I take personal offense to that).
